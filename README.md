We are happy to present you our final project on completing JAVA Advanced Bootcamp.

Emergency Alerting System is covering whole country territory alerting people via SMS about certain life threatening situations (e.g. natural disasters, AMBER alerts, public health threats, etc.), who are registered in a certain region. Twilio programmable communication platform is integrated in the App to support SMS sending functionality.

Front end features were developed using JavaFX, MySQL was used for storing recipients' phone numbers and Twilio platform for back end part allowing to send SMS.

In order to be able to create the same idea you will need a Twilio platform account with account SID and authentication token that are highly recommended to hide using environment variables or .env file.

The following functionality was developed in the App using:

• Sender's registration in the system;
• Registration process protection with a security code;
• Sender's login the system;
• 14 alert types to use depending on a threatening situation;
• 5 available regions to send SMS, separately or all together across the country;
• SMS area field for text message creating, editing and deleting;
• Send message button to execute the request;
• Notification request number availability for each SMS batch sent to check delivery status inside Twilio platform;
• Log out button to exit the application.
